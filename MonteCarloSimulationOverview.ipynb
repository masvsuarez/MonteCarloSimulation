    "As lattice size increases, fluctuations and error bars decrease massively. It is further observed that the point at which equilibrium is reached in the  magnetisation graph shifts from left to right (to increasing temperature) as lattice size is increasing. The first observation can be explained through the way data is processed. In small systems like 2x2, flipping of one spin has a huge impact on the absolute change in energy (1 in 4 spins), whereas the same flip in a 32x32 system has a minor contribution (1 in 1024). Latter will thus have a much smaller impact on the statistical means that are used to obtain the graphs. The second observation can also be explained through the quantity of spins in each lattice. As the Monte Carlo algorithm assigns multiple random numbers when it is called, it is much more likely to totally reverse a small system than a large one. I.e. completely reversing a system is much more likely to happen in a 2x2 lattice (4 different flips needed) versus a 32x32 lattice (1024 different flips needed!!!).\n",

I.e. larger spins system lead to smaller error / variance and thus a more narrow peak of the heat capacity. Ideally at very large lattice size this peak will become as narrow as possible.\n",
